# User Story: Database Migration from Supabase to Neon

## Title: Export and Migrate Database from Supabase to Neon

As a database administrator,
I want to export the entire database from Supabase in JSON format and import it into Neon,
So that I can successfully migrate our PostgreSQL database to a new provider without data loss.

## Acceptance Criteria:
1. All database tables (Novel, Chapter, Volume, User, RichText, and PrismaMigrations) are exported from Supabase as valid JSON files
2. The exported JSON files contain all records with accurate data types and relationships preserved
3. The JSON export includes all table schemas and constraints information
4. The exported data can be successfully imported into Neon PostgreSQL database
5. After import, all data integrity checks pass and application functionality remains unchanged
6. A rollback plan is documented in case of migration failure

## Edge Cases and Considerations:
- Large data sets may require batch processing to avoid memory issues
- Foreign key relationships must be maintained during import (proper table import order)
- Data type compatibility between Supabase and Neon PostgreSQL versions
- Connection string and authentication differences between providers
- Potential need to handle Supabase-specific extensions or features
- Performance impact during migration and verification process
- Backup strategy before starting the migration
